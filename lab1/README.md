- Jonathan Damone (s301514)
- Salvatore Licata (s295798)

## Sources
The greedy solution was implemented starting from the code in [Set-Cover-problem-solution-Python](https://github.com/AndreaRubbi/Set-Cover-problem-solution-Python/blob/master/Greedy.py)

## Results
### Greedy solution:
Optimized solution for N=5: w=5 (bloat=0%), nodes visited=125  
Optimized solution for N=10: w=12 (bloat=20%), nodes visited=250  
Optimized solution for N=20: w=30 (bloat=50%), nodes visited=204  
Optimized solution for N=100: w=171 (bloat=71%), nodes visited=3416  
Optimized solution for N=500: w=1256 (bloat=151%), nodes visited=21708  
Optimized solution for N=1000: w=2913 (bloat=191%), nodes visited=47047

### Combinations:
