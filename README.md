Folder with labs and project for the computational intelligence 2022/2023 course
## Collaboration
The code in this folder is developed in collaboration with  
- Jonathan Damone (s301514)
- Salvatore Licata (s295798)
## LAB1
Set Covering solution implemented in python using 
- greedy algorithm (not optimal but feasible for N=1000)
- combinations (memory error for N greater than 20)
- graph search (computation time excessive for N greater than 20)  
(after deadline)
- vanilla hill climbing
